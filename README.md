# Create a fair trade supply network with Hyperledger Fabric and IBM Blockchain Platform V2

This code pattern is based on a recent proof-of-concept developed in collaboration with a coffee roasting company that was nice enough to let us use their supply-chain documents. The finished product of this code pattern is a cloud-based blockchain API, that any other UI app can call. An example UI app that leverages our blockchain API can be found in the screenshots below.


Each cup has a history based on which batch of coffee was used make the cup, which you 
can see below. Additionally, you can see other details such as who poured the cup, 
at what time the cup was poured, which type of beans were used, etc. For example, a sample cup 'NJB123' for the result shown below.

![packageFile](/docs/bean.png)

In this code pattern we will create a blockchain app that increases visibility and efficiency in the supply chain of a coffee retailer using IBM Blockchain Platform V2 Beta. We will use different transactions to show different possible actions for the different participants in the supply chain. This sample application will record all transactions on the IBM Blockchain Platform V2 Beta, and enable a coffee retailer to ensure the customer that their coffee is organic and fair-trade. The code pattern can be useful to developers that are looking into learning more about creating applications that integrate supply chains with Hyperledger Fabric.

When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

* Interact with the (free) IBM Blockchain Platform V2 Beta
* Build a blockchain back-end using Hyperledger Fabric
* Create and use a (free) Kubernetes Cluster
* Deploy a Node.js app in the cloud that will interact with our smart contract

# Flow Description
1. The blockchain operator sets up the IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 service.
2. The IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 creates a Hyperledger Fabric network on an IBM Kubernetes 
Service, and the operator installs and instantiates the smart contract on the network.
3. The Node.js application server uses the Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network on IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 and creates APIs for a web client.
4. The Loopback 4 client uses the Node.js application API to interact with the network.
5. The user interacts with the Loopback 4 web interface to update and query the blockchain ledger and state.

## Prerequisites

This pattern assumes you have an **IBM Cloud account**, **VSCode** and **IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VSCode installed**

- [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration/?target=%2Fdashboard%2Fapps)
- [Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Install IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VSCode](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension)
- [Node v8.x or greater and npm v5.x or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

# Steps (Cloud Deployment)
> To run a local network, you can find steps [here](./docs/run-local.md).
1. [Clone the Repo](#step-1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Install Dependencies](#step-2-install-dependencies)
3. [Package Contract](#step-3-package-contract)
4. [Create IBM Cloud services](#step-4-create-ibm-cloud-services)
5. [Build a network](#step-5-build-a-network)
6. [Deploy blockchainbean2 Smart Contract on the network](#step-6-deploy-blockchainbean2-smart-contract-on-the-network)
7. [Connect application to the network](#step-7-connect-application-to-the-network)
8. [Run the application](#step-8-run-the-application)

## Step 1. Clone the Repo

Git clone this repo onto your computer in the destination of your choice, then go into the web-app folder:
```
HoreaPorutiu$ git clone https://github.com/horeaporutiu/blockchainbean2.git
```
Navigate to the `web-app` directory:
```
HoreaPorutiu$ cd blockchainbean2/web-app
```

## Step 2. Install Dependencies

Install required dependencies using NPM:
```
web-app$ npm install --ignore-scripts
```

## Step 3. Package Contract


![packageFile](/docs/rightClick.png)
Right-click under your folders in your workspace area and then click *Add Folder to Workspace* and then highlight the 
`blockchainbean/lib` directory as shown in the picture below, and then click on *add*:

![packageFile](/docs/addSmartContract.png)

 Next, we have to package the smart contract. Click on the *F1* button on your keyboard,
 which will bring up the VSCode command palette. From there, navigate and click on `Package a Smart Contract Project`.
![packageFile](/docs/pack.png)


 Next, the extension will ask the following question:
 ```
 Choose a workspace folder to package
 ```
 Click on the *lib* folder - note we do not want to package our client (i.e. our web-app directory).

  ![packageFile](/docs/lib.png)

 If all went well, you should see the following. 

  ![packageFile](/docs/packageSuccess.png)
 
 Note that this `.cds` file is extremely important if we want to run 
 our smart contract on the cloud. 

## Step 4. Create IBM Cloud services

* Create the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/containers-kubernetes).  You can find the service in the `Catalog`.  For this code pattern, we can use the `Free` cluster, and give it a name.  Note, that the IBM Cloud allows one instance of a free cluster and expires after 30 days. <b>The cluster takes around 10-15
minutes to provision, so please be patient!</b>

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/create-ibm-kubernetes-service.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Create the [IBM Blockchain Platform V2 Beta](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/blockchain/) service on the IBM Cloud.  You can find the service in the `Catalog`, and give a name.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/create-ibm-blockchain-2-service.gif">
</p>
<br>

* After your kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy your IBM Blockchain Platform V2 Beta on the cluster.  The service walks through few steps and finds your cluster on the IBM Cloud to deploy the service on.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/deploy-blockchain-on-cluster.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Once the Blockchain Platform is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, you can launch the console to start operating on your blockchain network.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/launch-ibm-blockchain.gif">
</p>
<br>

## Step 5. Build a network

We will build a network as provided by the IBM Blockchain Platform [documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/blockchain/howto/ibp-console-build-network.html#ibp-console-build-network).  This will include creating a channel with a single peer organization with its own MSP and CA (Certificate Authority), and an orderer organization with its own MSP and CA. We will create the respective identities to deploy peers and operate nodes.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/instantiate-smart-contract.gif">
</p>
<br>

## Step 7. Connect application to the network

* #### Connect with sdk through connection profile
  - Under the Instantiated Smart Contract, click on `Connect with SDK` from the overflow menu on the right side of the row.
  - Choose from the dropdown for <b>MSP for connection</b>, `org1msp`.
  - Choose from <b>Certificate Authority</b> dropdown, `Org1 CA`.
  - Download the connection profile by scrolling down and clicking <b>Download Connection Profile</b>.  This will download the connection json which we will use soon to establish connection.
  - You can click <b>Close</b> once the download completes.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/connect-with-sdk.gif">
</p>
<br>

* #### Create an application admin
  - Go to the <b>Nodes</b> tab on the left bar, and under <b>Certifacte Authorities</b>, choose your organization CA, <b>Org1 CA</b>.
  - Click on <b>Register user</b>.
  - Give an <b>Enroll ID</b> and <b>Enroll Secret</b> to administer your application users, `app-admin` and `app-adminpw`.
  - Choose `client` as <b>Type</b> and any organization for affiliation.  We can pick `org1` to be consistent.
  - You can leave the <b>Maximum enrollments</b> blank.
  - Under <b>Attributes</b>, click on <b>Add attribute</b>.  Give attribute as `hf.Registrar.Roles` = `*`.  This will allow this identity to act as registrar and issues identities for our app.  Click <b>Add-attribute</b>.
  - Click <b>Register</b>.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/register-app-admin.gif">
</p>
<br>


* #### Update application connection
  - Copy the connection profile you downloaded into [server folder](server)
  - Name the connection profile you downloaded **ibpConnection.json**
  - Your new folder structure should look like below (i.e. should have your newly downloaded and newly renamed file **ibpConnection.json**: 

  <p align="center">
    <img src="docs/ibpConnection.png">
  </p>

  - The **ibpConnection.json** file should look something like this: 

   <p align="center">
    <img src="docs/ibpConnectionCode.png">
  </p>

  - Update the [config.json](server/config.json) file with:
    - The connection json file name you downloaded.
    - The <b>enroll id</b> and <b>enroll secret</b> for your app admin, which we earlier provided as `app-admin` and `app-adminpw`.
    - The orgMSP ID, which we provided as `org1msp`.
    - The caName, which can be found in your connection json file under "organization" -> "org1msp" -> certificateAuthorities". This would be like an IP address and a port. This is circled in red above.
    - The username you would like to register.
    - Update gateway discovery to `{ enabled: true, asLocalhost: false }` to connect to IBP.

> the current default setup is to connect to a local fabric instance from VS Code

- Once you are done, the final version of the **config.json** should look something like this (note that I took the caName from the above pic):

```js
{
    "connection_file": "ibpConnection.json",
    "appAdmin": "app-admin",
    "appAdminSecret": "app-adminpw",
    "orgMSPID": "org1msp",
    "caName": "173.193.106.28:32634",
    "userName": "user1",
    "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }
}
```


## Step 8. Run the application

* #### Enroll admin
  - First, navigate to the `server` directory, and install the node dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
  - ⚠️ if you get a grpc error run:
    ```bash
    npm rebuild
    ```
  
  - Run the `enrollAdmin.js` script
    ```bash
    node enrollAdmin.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    ```bash
    msg: Successfully enrolled admin user app-admin and imported it into the wallet
    ```

* #### Register User
  - Run the `registerUser.js` script.
    ```bash
    node registerUser.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    ```bash
    Successfully registered and enrolled admin user user1 and imported it into the wallet
    ```
  - If you get an error such as this 
  
  ```Error: fabric-ca request register failed with errors [[{"code":0,"message":"Registration of 'user1' failed: Identity 'user1' is already registered"}]]```

  go ahead and change the user in **config.json** file, you can use any
  username you want. Once you save the **config.json** with a new user, 
  for example:

  ```
      "userName": "user4",

  ```
  Run the same script agian.


* #### Start the web client
  - In a new terminal, open the web-app folder from the room blockchainbean2 directory.
    ```bash
    cd web-app
    ```

  - Start the client:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```


You can find the app running at http://localhost:8080/explorer  If all goes well, you should see something like the picture below: 

![packageFile](/docs/loopback.png)
To get started submitting our first transaction on the network, we can update the ledger 
with some of our suppliers info, such as their address, their uniqueId, and their 
organization. To do this, first  click on `GrowerController`. You should see the Controller 
expand with the GET/POST methods. Click on the green `POST/Grower` button and then `Try it out` to 
the right of the `POST/Grower` button. This will enable you to write in a request body. Go ahead 
and copy and paste the following JSON in to the request body. P.S. (I have made all the commands 
available in the commands.txt file).

```json
{
  "$class": "org.ibm.coffee.Grower",
  "isFairTrade": true,
  "growerId": "Grower-0201",
  "organization": "Ethiopia Gedeb 1 Banko Gotiti GrainPro",
  "address": {
    "$class": "org.ibm.coffee.Address",
    "city": "Gedeb",
    "country": "Ethiopia",
    "street": "N/A",
    "zip": "N/A"
  }
}
```
Then click the blue Execute button under the request body. If all goes well, you should see something similar to the image below:

![packageFile](/docs/grower.png)

If all went well, you can now go into your blockchain network, click on the channel, and then
you should see the block height increased, and if you click on the last block, you should
see the latest JSON that we inputted being written to the blockchain. **Note:** The gif shows
how to get to your channel and transaction overview. Your transaction data should be different - 
it should show updating the ledger with the information of `Grower-0201`.

The rest of the commands for uploading supply chain documents can be 
found [here.](https://github.com/horeaporutiu/blockchainbean2/blob/master/docs/run-local.md#add-members-to-the-network)

## Bonus Step - Deploy your local app to the Cloud
If you want to keep your application running all the time, 
you'll want to deploy it to the cloud.

To do this, please follow the guide [here:](https://github.com/horeaporutiu/blockchainbean2/blob/master/docs/deploy.md)

## Conclusion

So yes! Go ahead and run the /POST transactions as shown in 
[these steps](https://github.com/horeaporutiu/blockchainbean2/blob/master/docs/run-local.md#step-6-submit-transactions), and
 everything will be stored on the IBM Blockchain Platform. So now, you are 
 officially done with this tutorial. So what did you learn?

- How to create a smart contract project with the IBM Blockchain VSCode extension.
- How to deploy your smart contract on a local Hyperledger Fabric network.
- How to update the ledger by submitting transactions to the network.
- Hyperledger stores data as key-value pairs, so to look up data on the network, you need to pass in a key that has a value associated with it. We did that by running the query method.
- How to create a Kubernetes Cluster and IBM Blockchain Platform V2 Beta service and to connect our client Loopback application to our cloud service via the connection profile we downloaded.
- How to view the ledger of a specific channel, by clicking on the channel, the ledger, and then the individual transactions. 

So at this point, you know more than me! Hopefully you feel pretty good at this point, and can dive a bit deeper into other, more complex topics, such as how to scale your network, how to optimize performance, etc. But for now, you know all of the basics to run a supply chain network on Hyperledger Fabric, both locally, and on the Cloud.

GREAT JOB! YOU DID IT! :) 

And when you create the cool new startup unicorn after learning a bunch from this tutorial, don't forget to give me, or IBM Developer some credit :)
